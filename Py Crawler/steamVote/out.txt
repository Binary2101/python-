i like this game it s cool 
          
best game ever    simple but deadly   
          
starvation is now   x more enjoyable  thank you klei
          
this is epic but can you add killing yourself to the game pls
          
good cooperative gameplay animals are good mods make the game really come to life but it kinda needs more activity 
          
loved it 
          
when i bought don t starve together i played like   hrs and i don t like it but now i really love it  but i have one problem with this don t starve together  this is don t starve together but i don t have any friends to play with them    
          
super nice and interesting to play
          
its like real life but better
          
ah  yes  now i can live for three whole days and die of insanity with a friend 
          
    ing good
          
it s a great game  i love it and thanks to the steam community there are so many different mods so almost anything is possible 
          
      
          
a fun and challenging game the whole family enjoys playing together   even with all the hours i ve played  i still haven t mastered the game     i have yet to survive a full year without playing in endless mode 
          
perfect game game
          
god soive the queen mom   damn roite albert  god save her olrite 
          
lore  art  mechanics   
          
nice game  
          
i tried this game during free trial and liked it but the sale ended before i could buy it so then i didn t have enough to get the game does anyone have a free copy they can gift to me  it would be much appreciated  thanks 
          
a great game that you should have in your library 
          
trash
          
ok game 
          
its so fun  d
          
very good game  good job klei  you did wonderful job
          
don t starve is a deceivingly hard series  no doubt  dst makes it easier  but not to a point where it s stupidly easy  i ve been addicted to this game for the past few weeks  to a point where i want to buy this for more of my friends if you like don t starve  or stylistic hard survival games  this is definitely for you pro tip  you need friends for this one  if you hate people  then may i recommend don t starve instead 
          
i like the game  very good 
          
it sucks
          
very good game  
          
a great  and infuriating  game with a mostly very positive and kind community      would starve again
         
        
it s a lot of fun to play with friends  but ironically i ve found it a lot more fun to play it alone  the game lets you play as all but one characters off the bat so it was nice to be able to go back to playing webber after coming my console without having to go through the hassle of unlocking him  the customization on the worlds are also a lot better than the singleplayer  and is very helpful if you wanna make the game a bit easier or a bit harder through carious individual adjustments 
          
is gud game  that is all can have bad times though 
          
your squad better be on point brutha
          
luv it 
          
fun game i love it
          
its     ing great man
         
        
this is a great game    it feels like terraria and minecraft  you know in that area of games  fun with your friends and plays smoothly    doesnt get too boring after a while as you ll likely find a new thing  i got it as a gift from a friend but its definitely worth the money   
          
my favourite coop game  amazing world  always something new to discover  the updates are great and keep me coming back to this game 
          
it s a classic survival experience in a world of unexpected things you will probably get frustrated   die quite a lot   you may wonder what is the goal  but multiplayer with strong integrated mod support make for some great fun  i d recommend it 
         
        
fun with friends  not so much alone  for me beautifully easy modsupport with easy online too fun to play around with   very customizeable
          
if you like survival games that make you eat every   seconds  this is the game for you
          
the base game but for playing with others fantastic game  i ve enjoying playing with my significant other for some time now  currently thinking of opening a dedicated server to host the game to more of my friends   
          
    fun to play together    nice art style    nice music and atmosphere    much to explore
          
very fun  especially with friends 
          
this game is the best steam game i ever played  you can never get bored of this game it gets updated and you have so much things to do ingame  you can even get a chest which can move any time by simply finding a specific item on the mapthe game is sparkling with ideas you also have sanity which i dont see in many games if u dont have sanity u become insane and you basically fight spirits  this game offers many mobs and some are friendly if you dont attack for example beefalos pigmen and such theres also a chance at night hands will appear and they will try to stop your camp fireand also a group of hounds will attack you but you can defend yourself with beefalos or pigs yeah u can tame them and they will attack them at your will also what i like about this game when you buy it a friend can give a copy of the game to you so you dont have to buy it it also works with gifts the community for the game is amazing never seen such good people in this game i posted a steam discussion saying that i need people to play the game with me and people added me and they have been nice to me even tho im a noob and they were very supportive saying that i will get better at the game you can get friends in this game that easily its amazing i recommend this game      no doubt
          
i don t know what it is about this game but it s not appealing to me at all take my word for granite  but i just don t like this game    
          
i ve played this game long enough to know that is so unique  the graphics  and gameplay is so fun  i love playing with friends  and surviving together  it really is a great game  and i m glad i decided to grab it    
          
it s pretty good 
          
the awesome game can be played loosely  and in dst together you can pick up items everyday so it s worth it  it s really worth it  i m on the plus side    
          
thanks klei  very cool fr tho once i actually started playing this game  it skyrocketed in my  most played  list  a lot of fun  especially if you bring a friend or two with you  you can play seriously or just mess around and i love this game a lot    
          
its about time i reviewed this game ive owned it for   years its great the perfect game to relax and just enjoy  thank you for your time and effort developing this game your blood sweat and tears have not gone un noticed  thank you again
          
love it 
          
when i play dst i m always playing wormwood and afk farming until i get that sweet     dragonfruit garden  which is clearly the best way to play the game     like why would you put yourself in danger going to caves and spider nests and ruins       when there s chat with some chill ppl it s like stardew valley but you get memes and social experience  oh and there s a lot of fun things to do like organising the chests  picking up after people  making food to keep your fellow survivors smooth brained sane and creating clusters of bramble traps to commit genocide and biological warfare on the bunnymen population  sometimes everyone finally comes back after leaving base for so long exploring caves and mining and getting into god knows what kind of danger and we can all sit at the god damn dinner table and eat like a family agai       when there s that one toxic guy that doesn t like you talking and insists on being le epic gamer tryhard in a co op lag spiking public server in australia or something  then makes a whole scene about how he s gonna mute you and how he doesn t like it when you pick berries or where you place down your crops  or accuses you of doing absolutely nothing while raiding all three iceboxes of vegetables      there s always something to complain aboutalso      if you ve been playing for hours and finally everyone else leaves  leaving you to toil for all eternity  farming plants  luring bunnymen through bramble traps  making meatballs  day in day out  until you find your mind in the real world shrivelling up from the isolation and monotony  too reliant on others to continue  yet too fearful and unskilled to take risks and experiment with the world outside the base  eventually summer sets everything on fire anyway dst aka plant housewaifu simulator is an iconic and fun game for people of all ages and skill levels  i recommend you find a friend to play it with though  and to not let it ruin your sleep schedule  i think i should go sleep now it s   am and im feeling lightheaded
         
        
adding onto the original don t starve single player game  ds together allows players to interact with friends  and play on online servers  and even though it s hard and quite frustrating at times  klei somehow manages to balance the difficulty and fun of the game   minimizing the amounts of times you  i  will rage quit  lastly this game comes with an extra copy that you can gift to a friend  it s worth the money 
          
    
         
        
if you like to play don t starve or willing to play it with friends  you should just bought this game  no question asked 
          
tim burtons wet dream  maybe  and with crafting  obviously play with one or more friends  youll get a solid amount of hours out of it
          
beefalo
          
klei is very generous with items  everyday you get   free item that you can sell in the steam market and additional   items per week every hour of gameplay 
          
i m sorry but i just can t recommend this game  i ve been playing it recently with my wife and son in co op and it just feels like there was no real design plan  no project management or oversight  it feels like an artist came up with a bunch of art assets and threw them into a quickly built survival tutorial they found somewhere without giving any real thought to the game beyond  this seems like a cool idea   survival games generally swing between being too easy  and being an exercise in frustration  this one tends to the latter not because of complexity or genuine difficulty but rather arbitrary systems  poor feedback  in game  on your actions and what you re doing  and a whole slew of bugs  issues and design flaws i m not going to go into specifics because quite frankly i ve done enough for these developers by buying the game and giving them my money  don t make the same mistake  get something else to satisfy your survival urges 
          
this game was fun but i think it was too hard as well i recomend it if you want to play hard survival games with your friend
          
dont buy it  waste of time and money  terrible instructions how to play game  only cool thing is their graphics and how cool it looks
          
i don t think i ve ever disliked a critically acclaimed game so hard  this game is the antithesis of good user experience  and you re forced to navigate through some of the most abhorrent ui design i ve ever encountered in any game to survive in a world that is exceedingly unfair and unrelentingly ruthless if you somehow manage to survive for longer than a few days  you re forced to slog through endless obstacles that will have you saying  what the      did i just die to  over and over again  if you somehow manage to survive all the surprise mechanics that the game floods you with  you ll find that the gameplay is dull and repetitive with no real substance  it s like a game that begs the player not to play it i ve given this game so many chances  but don t starve together has definitely secured a position in my least favorite games ever created and due to its niche appeal  i wouldn t recommend it to the overwhelming majority of people 
          
hello  although this isn t a review  its just a question but if you do want to know my answer for the review  i d say this game is really fun and addicting to hang out with friends and just overall survive  but my question was  if you don t have wormwood and you buy the wormwood chest  or the wormwood deluxe chest  would you get wormwood or a skin of him even though you don t even have him somebody answer me  i really want wormwood and i want to know if the best way to get him is spools or just buying the chest to get him  thanks yours truly  party exe
          
would rather eat dirt cookies than play this game
          
the only flaw with this game is the fact there s no way to buy an individual copied to ensure each friend only has one copy from me  not an extra free copy     i have   friends to which i want to give the game  don t really trust either of them to give the extra copy back in all other regards  minus the lack of adventure mode  the teleportatato  and dlc   this game is just as good as don t starve  but better because you can play with friends 
          
this game is great 
         
        
pretty great 
          
amazing  it s almost impossible to stay away from this game forever 
          
this is a bad game   played a lot of survival games and rogue likes  but this one is missing the addicting qualities of those games   i would say the first   hours are painfully boring  almost like a  chore   even if you learn what to do differently and go   day farther the next time  you still have to sift through the monotony of the first   hours getting absolutely nowhere   i actually kind of wish it was never on my shopping list  i would preferably like to refund this title so i can remove the funds from the developers who created it 
          
i didnt play that game realy much for now but i already like it you are going to die some often times if your new or dont know how to play this game like me but you will like it after some time with an good player aka  mate you can have a realy good time as well so there are no worries in this game that your never going to have fun in don t starve together  di give this game an     
          
this game is so fun  i have played this game for many hours and i m still playing it without any feeling of  boredom  
          
garbo
          
who tryna no life with me on this game 
          
 oh cool  a hunt   that s a really big dog  
          
first played it during a free trial steam sale in       haven t left it since  it feels different than most other games in the survival genre and has great updates every now and then 
          
it s like don t starve but with friends   of course if you have those friends 
          
this game is fun and addicting  my family love it as well 
          
dysfunctional co op
          
what a game  
          
                                                                                                                                           
         
        
best game ever
          
this game is incredible  i highly recommend it to everyone fantastic fun  and an amazingly dedicated dev team  klei is my favourite game company to date it s essentially a management game  you manage   metres  health  sanity  and hunger  if one gets too low you ll be closer to dying  with multiplay  you can look out for your friends and help them in surviving  even after about     hours  my boyfriend an i still haven t beaten all of the bosses or found all of the items  it s a fantastically fun experience if you want to see a video i made to show what it s like playing with friends  here s a link to one i recorded a while back  low quality audio  sorry  https   www youtube com watch v  ccbciajrlw t  si actually find it way more fun than don t starve  myself and my boyfriend regularly play it together  and it s got an easy enough code used to make the character so that you can make your own original characters in the game 
          
bad
          
don t starve together they said so i ate green mushrooms to combat hunger  only to go insane  
         
        
this is a really great game i really like this one but i dont have enough money to buy it i played dont starve for about    minutes in one weekend i cant really focus on the game cause i have school dont judge im only human heheheheh if you feel bad for me you can gift me the game
          
 tami i used to die alot but a bootiful friend helped me out owo also great game lolol 
          
with the follow up of the vanilla version of the  st  the online is very friendly community and a good way to make some friends in order to survive together  if not you brawl out with rest of the community in game modes  and with new characters on the way the adventures are endless 
         
        
a nice multiplayer addition to the original gameexcept its so laggy for non hosts that it destroys friendshipsthe server modding is probably the best thing about it 
          
this game is really fun iv e been playing it for so many years now absolutely love it  this game is      a masterpiece the art style is phenomenalthe community is amazingthe game is a fun challenge even if you think you are very experienced anything can happen  damn merms it s called don t starve but i don t think starving is what you have to worry about from bees to tree guards all hell can fall upon youso watch your back remember charlie is always watching   
          
masterpiece 
          
gud

the best survival game ever 
          
nice game  steamhappy  
          
it is a  d minecraft   maybe but that was so cool and very complex to play this game are suitable for those player who seeking for challenge
          
it s a very interesting and fun game to play with your friends 
          
i hev no friendo it not fun for me
         
        
nice
         
        
cool game but i dont have it anymore
         
        
wendy best grill   prove me wrong
          
its a nice game but  with your friends play online and enjoy   
          
very fun
          
this game has everything that makes it  worth while the  people you meet are lovely  the art style is  quite polished  and the game takes a decent while to learn   sure new players are going  to die  but after a  while things start to become clearer and clearer   i cant recommend this  game enough
          
it s my favourite game  i absolutely love it  i recommend it to my friends                                                                               
          
i love this game  i like the tim burton kinda feel it has  there is so much to do and unlock and it keeps me and my friends entertained for very long periods of time  it can be challenging  frustrating but that has never stopped the group from laughing their butts off at some of the various ways to die  you can play solo or in a big group  even if all your friends are wes     send help    overall  very fun game 
          
yeet
          
people are so selfish lol this game should be called dont starve   antisocial
          
for a game named  don t stave  there is quite a lot of staving involved 
          
it s hard  and requires lots of micro managing  otherwise you die  think of it as the darksouls of survival games  from a   to cheese covered ferris wheel  i give the game four milk drenched bill cosby s
          
very epic very cool yes
          
this game is hard    or im just badbut either way this game is fun af      
          
i was murdered by a giant     ing treemanyeah its pretty good
          
yes
         
        
fun with friends
          
it was fun  but then i died 
          
really entertaining and cute 
         
        
this don t starve version is very good  its more challenging than others it had in game events the story is more exciting and overrall good job klei oh and it also has skins
          
yes  end of conversation 
          
the greatest game of all time  however if your friends are lameos and can t appreciate a true masterpiece then i d recommend don t starve instead of don t starve together 
          
sanity    hunger    health     this is going to end badly   
          
im hungry
          
hit this yeet yup for sure yes 
         
        
very difficult  a lot to learn and master  quite fun 
         
        
jogo top d   agr vc pode ficar morrendo com seus amigos tbm
          
i have no friend to play this gameso i can t play this game it s suck and sad   
          
berry fun
          
yim yum  
         
        
i try to love it  but several problems whenever i try to host a game  it gives me a warning error most common is unknown error  sometimes it just says warning  nothing else and i tried shutting down all mods etc etc  but same thing sometimes when i try to join a running game  it gives me the same error but it has crash info but on both joining or hosting  sometimes the game screen goes pitch black  or automatically stops running the game in general but i ve never seen anyone else have these kind of errors  so you can buy it but my copy is just plain malfunctions 
          
after    years  the auto delete all your save games bug is still around  just lost      hours of saves 
         
        
good game  financially destroyed my friend  died in record time  generally a good experience
          
don t starve but with a new twist  you step on cancerous growths everywhere you go 
          
an awesome game to die with friends nice art stylegood gameplayhounds      
          
     game
          
 
          
 
          
why did i bought this game   i hate multiplayer     i like all don t starves  but this unistalling   bye money  xd
          
i got killed by a guy that got killed by a rabbit person
          
i love the gameplay style and skins 
          
      would die from the darkness again
          
i absolutely adore this game it s fun and addicting especially if you play it with friends  the characters are all unique in their own ways and have stories to why they re  here  or why they like these certain things  the name of the game itself is understandable as you don t want to starve but there are plenty of other ways in the game to die too it s a really fun game i highly recommend other people play this game
          
so here s the very good thing  you get a copy of the game when you buy it  i bought another cuz i didn t notice gift   really fun game  but make sure your friend isn t impatient or easily mad because this game will really make them rage quit  still though  when you die you learn more and each time you play you will progress more  bought it during summer sale better during sale 
          
has to be one of the best games i ve played in my life  me and my friends get sucked into it for hours at a time        klei 
          
                                      
          
very good
          
true survival masterpiece
          
i honestly don t regret buying this game i had it for about two months now  so if you re thinking about buying this game there isn t a reason to think just buy the game  my experience  when i first got the game i had no idea what i was doing i legit just bought the game i never seen any videos so i just kinda went with the flow  i just started picking things up and making stuff to survive  sounds simple   it s not if you don t understand like me  so i watched a few youtube videos and twitch streams then i finally got it  so yeah now i play everyday and my experience is a       con s   legit just one con whenever you join a open game cause this is multiplayer sometimes nobody helps you or texts in chat which can be a bore so why make a server and not type in it anyways that s all cya 
          
in this game you will be killed for no reason  you will die  you will be backstabed  but it does not matter because you have webber
          
fun game
          
if you and your friends are bored and need something to play together  this game is a must  very enjoyable  really well made  super entertaining  and can be replayed numerous times without getting old 
          
repetitive  boring  unbalanced  time consuming grinding garbage unrewarding  unwelcoming  unintuitive  tedious many more words come to the mind  but i will stop  because this game is not worth the attention 
          
it s a great game  always learning as you play and there are so many things you can do  but most importantly  you must survive 
          
more like don t accomplish anything together because you just die constantly  and then when you die in winter for the   th time since downloading the game and respawn with nothing  because your base is far away and there s nothing at the spawn point you just freeze to death which makes it the   st time 
          
alright so you and your buddies spawn next to some weird gate thing  cool  fast forward a little bit  you ve set up a base near some beefalo and everything is going well but winter is coming soon so you gotta be prepared  get more food  get more wood  get more stone  and build some walls  fast forward to your epic deforestation montage   oh no a big      off tree monster thing ah     you die  oh okay small setback no problem  regather your items and continue  fast forward to the day before winter   distant roaring of death approaching your camp   did you hear that  a big      off racoon giant monster of death and destruction has its way with you  your friends  your base  your food supply  and your beefalo  and that is the end of your   ish hour grind with a couple of buddies  good luck  start another game and try again 
          
this game will kick your butt  however you ll enjoy it  the game doesn t hold your hand in fact it pushes you down the stairs and yet you ll want to play it again and again   deceptively frightening game for having such simple graphics 
         
        
this game is insane i have tried this free but time expired  so i wanna buy it but i dont have enough money for that   so i wanna play it with friend its so funny   bought this guys game is insane 
          
one of the most difficult survival games    you can die because of almost everything  create your team and try to survive the winter  even the summer is a trouble too  fortunately there are  many options to change the amount of creatures and plants on the world while creating a new world as host  so you can set difficulty of your experience  great game  great performance and great price   thumbs up 
          
     game
          
this game was incredibly entertaining to play with my friends and i highly recommend others try it with theirs too
          
nice
          
you can really have fun playing this with friends  good survival game 
          
i died due hunger
          
one of the best survival games i have every     ing played  good mechanics and its haaaard   better with friends though 
          
its a great game with friends   but its pretty hard tho 
          
great for the imagination  fun for the whole friends and family  and the title says the most important rule 
          
great multiplayer  make sure you have good connection
          
boring crappy game  not fun at all
          
i like this game a lot  very good  played it a little 
          
it s a fun survival game  it has a lot of uniqueness and you re always finding new things  it s a lot more fun with friends so i suggest you get some in a discord call or something because random people are hit or miss 
          
good time waster
          
more like don t develop the game to be any good   in this game you grow the crop but eat the crop and the crop is gone  first you play the game  then you starve  but ins t the game called dont starve  no  misleading and confused design by the developers at klei enticement  then after die the title of game literally tell you off for playing the way it is meant to be played  regardless  how do i starve or not starve when i get killed in one hit by the spider  it is unfair  oh  and the big thing that separates this to be any different from the first game in the starve game series is the fact that more player mean more mouth to feed  can you guess  it make you starve faster this is literally against the point of the game  hello  develops at klei endictment  swing and a miss  more like swing and a cant hit anything because control makes it impossible to win   i love this game to death  but in its current state  i simply cannot leave a negative review don t starve  more like don t start 
          
great gameplay  love the challenge this game provides
          
great game full of content and support  you can sink a lot of hours in this game definitely worth it plus the developers really care about their community and games      
          
my fav game   
         
almost as cool as hentai 
         
can be fun with friends      
         
fun little game to play with friend  lots of mods
         
yes 
         
can t even play the game i hate it
         
do you like rust  do you like minecraft  survival   and do you like ark  survival evolved buy this game ffs
         
best game survival 
         
it s good to find out that all of your friends are idiots
         
very good game for fun 
         
it s alright i guess
         
i only starved like thirty times
         
playing this with friends has been one of the best experiences of my life  even though they suck   
         
i recommended this game   it it s awesome    
         
it s a really good game  but its also very hard  and if you don t have friends to play this with you re better off buying the singleplayer version
        
in don t starve together obviously everything is about not to starve  but if that was the only way you could die in this  d open world survival game it would be kind of boring   right  luckily that is not the case because basically anything might kill you if you don t watch out  various beasts  catastrophes  shadow figures or feeble minded pigs might cross your way and won t make it easy for you to stay alive in this rough world  so why not invite some friends  the title says it all  other than the singleplayer   don t starve  here you should probably bring some company to explore the world and exist against those horrible creatures  but if it wasn t difficult enough   the weather won t be on your side for long either  it might be rather challenging to play this game and there are a lot of mechanics and tricks that make dst unique  but you will need quite some experience to figure them out the very charming graphics and humor will make you love the game quicker than you want characters you can select from a lot of different characters for your journey  who all have their very personal pros   cons the specific abilities and weaknesses make the gameplay exciting and miscellaneous everytime again  trust me  from robots and spiders to scientists and warrior valkyries your choice is kind of unlimited  even more and better characters are still developed  and up to you and your fellow survivors base building of course you can wander around as a nomad  gather ressources and be on track all the time but the essence to be progressive in dst is to build yourself a base for all your needs  i mean who wouldn t prefer some delicious meatballs fresh from the crockpot over berries and carrots  in order to set up your buildings you can t just immediately cobble together some boards and stones like a pig   you have to invent them before  by the huge variety of items in the game it won t be easy to obtain them all  so good luck boss creatures every now and then some more or less scary meanies will come to destroy your well deserved progress  better be prepared and packed with armor  weapons and perhaps some magical items to defeat them   psst  they also have unique loot which will grant you access to craft cool gadgets or equipments to make your living easier   the caves on the one hand there s the actually quite harmless overworld with its rich land but on the other there s also the underground which has a lot of dangerous and scary beasts lurking for you in the darkness  but if you can prevail down there  you will probably be abled to find the magical secrets of the ruins  which should be discovered by yourself  once you have beaten them you can rule the overworld with your knowledge skins  and how to get them yes  here you ll also find those skins for items you might already know from other games   don t worry   they re just cosmetic and won t give you any advantage  besides the advantage of spicy looking characters  tools or buildings  and you can even share the skins on tools or buildings with your friends in game  so everyone profits from them   you get   skin drop everyday by logging in and   skin drops every week by playing  caution  science required some might be marketable and some might not be  but they look cool non the less  dyou can also purchase skin collections in the shop of the game to support the developers and maybe you re lucky and you can even make some money of selling or trading them   the game is definitely worth the full price and the long time motivation is assured sooo   what are you waiting for  you can t have enough time to explore the wild depths of don t starve together the original gamehttps   store steampowered com app        dont starve   nightphilipp
         
this game has carrat      
         
everything is more fun when you re playing together   even starving  also moosegoose  meesegeese  idk
         
i need more people to play with   i have this game but no one ever plays with me  but i really want to play more i really enjoy playing it with others when i can and do 
        
        
don t starve together is a multiplayer cooperative version of the original  the differences are only formal  you don t need to open characters  so that you can sit down with your friends to play   the resurrection procedure is much simpler  otherwise it wouldn t be very convenient if one of the players could die and forever   some characters rebalanced  t  in the single player version  some heroes are frankly stronger than others   and also all the plot questions are omitted  for the plot  as usual  in the regular version of the game   otherwise  this is good old don t starve  it is played cheerfully  there are no departures  it is also problematic to survive    ents out of
